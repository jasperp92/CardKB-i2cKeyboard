This is a MakeCode extension for the Grove Keyboard "CardKB" of M5Stack. It's still in the making.
This extension will work for the Calliope mini as well for the BBC micro:bit.


### Wiring:
On the Calliope mini the wiring is quite simple. Just plug the keyboard to the left A0 Grove-port. 
It uses the I²C protocol. The I²C-address of the keyboard is **0x5F (95)**.
